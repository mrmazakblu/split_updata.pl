UNPACKING Hauwei update.app 
from inside android

download the  Splitupdate perl script from --- https://github.com/mrmazakblu/split_updata.pl  (download the repo zip)
extract splitupdate to folder 

Using an android file manager browse to the "Download" folder and unzip the updates.

Install "termux" in your android (from play store or apk mirror of choice)

open termux and add perl by running this command "pkg install perl" 


***termux uses its own symlinks to android filesystem so some paths are different.****

The following commands are assumeing the locations of files to be inside the standard android download folder.
ASSUMED LOCATIONS:
UPDATE.APP = /sdcard/Download/update/UPDATE.APP                       in termux = storage/downloads/update/UPDATE.APP
splitupdate = /sdcard/Download/split_update.pl-master/splitupdate     in termux = storage/downloads/split_update.pl-master/splitupdate


open termux (adjust file locations in following command to match your needs)

Example to extract all images:
storage/downloads/split_update.pl-master/splitupdate storage/downloads/update/UPDATE.APP . storage/downloads

The above should unpack the update.app into individual image files in the "output" folder. The "." in needed. 
It selects all images to be extracted, if you want only one image replace the "." with the image name. 

Example to extract only ramdisk.img
storage/downloads/split_update.pl-master/splitupdate storage/downloads/update/UPDATE.APP ramdisk storage/downloads

Location for this folder will be 
"storage/downloads/output" as far as termux is concerned, and "/sdcard/Download/output" in the android file system
